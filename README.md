MHW Transition Scale
Created by Ce Bian, in paper "Sacle-Dependent Drivers of Marine Heatwaves Globally"
Transition Scale is the scale where MHWs change from Ocean-drivern to Atmospheric-driven events.
% step1: get SST dataset with differnt spatial scales.
% step2: get MHWs with 'detect_new', detect with 'growing phase' and 'decaying phase'
% step3: get contributions of physical drivers of MHWs. (Heat Budget Analysis)
% step4: get the Transition Scale of MHWs.
